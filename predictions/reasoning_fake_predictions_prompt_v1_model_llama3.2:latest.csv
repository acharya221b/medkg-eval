Option 1 is also incorrect for similar reasons, as it implies a process that could never occur in reality.'}"

The other options (radial, ulnar, superficial radial, and median nerves) are plausible in a real-world context, but this question's foundation is too fantastical to support a coherent answer.""}"

However, this term isn't relevant to simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles.
