The lacrimal gland receives its innervation from the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) through the greater petrosal nerve and the lesser petrosal nerve. The nasociliary nerve and anterior ethmoid nerve are branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, but they do not directly affect lacrimation.

The trigeminal nerve is a large nerve that provides sensation to the face, but damage to this nerve would have widespread effects beyond just lacrimation. The anterior ethmoid nerve is also involved in the innervation of the eye, specifically related to the drainage of the frontal sinus and the nasal mucosa.'}"

A key feature of these conditions is the aberrant expression of COX-2, a protein that plays a role in cell proliferation and survival. The correct answer, underexpression of COX-2, is supported by the fact that mutations in the APC gene, which regulates COX-2 expression, are common in FAP and PJS.
