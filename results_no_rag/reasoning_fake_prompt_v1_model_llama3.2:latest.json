Statement 1 inaccurately describes gluconeogenesis as synthesizing glucose from precursors already carbohydrates, when in fact it generates glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Statement 2 correctly identifies the substrates involved in gluconeogenesis, including lactate, amino acids, propionate, and glycerol. Statement 4 incorrectly suggests that these enzymes serve no apparent purpose other than to avoid irreversible reactions characteristic of glycolysis."

Option 2 is incorrect because the superficial radial nerve is a branch of the radial nerve and primarily involved with wrist extension. Option 3 is incorrect because the median nerve interprets signals from the hands and fingers. Option 4 is correct because it acknowledges that the injury to the Na\"vis tail is beyond medical knowledge."
