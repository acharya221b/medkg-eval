(2) A fiberoptic metal vaginal speculum is a metal instrument, with fiberoptic light, used to expose and illuminate the interior of the vagina. (3) A metal vaginal speculum is a metal instrument used to expose the interior of the vagina. (4) An umbilical scissors is a cutting instrument, with two opposed shearing blades, used to cut the umbilical cord. (5) A uterine clamp is an instrument used to hold the uterus by compression. (6) A uterine packer is an instrument used to introduce dressing into the uterus or vagina. (7) A vaginal applicator is an instrument used to insert medication into the vagina. (8) A vaginal retractor is an instrument used to maintain vaginal exposure by separating the edges of the vagina and holding back the tissue. (9) A gynecological fibroid hook is an instrument used to exert traction upon a fibroid. (10) A pelvimeter (external) is an instrument used to measure the external diameters of the pelvis.</td>\n",

       "0   An obstetric-gynecologic general manual instrument is one of a group of devices used to perform simple obstetric and gynecologic manipulative functions. This generic type of device consists of the following: (1) An episiotomy scissors is a cutting instrument, with two opposed shearing blades, used for surgical incision of the vulvar orifice for obstetrical purposes. (2) A fiberoptic metal vaginal speculum is a metal instrument, with fiberoptic light, used to expose and illuminate the interior of the vagina. (3) A metal vaginal speculum is a metal instrument used to expose the interior of the vagina. (4) An umbilical scissors is a cutting instrument, with two opposed shearing blades, used to cut the umbilical cord. (5) A uterine clamp is an instrument used to hold the uterus by compression. (6) A uterine packer is an instrument used to introduce dressing into the uterus or vagina. (7) A vaginal applicator is an instrument used to insert medication into the vagina. (8) A vaginal retractor is an instrument used to maintain vaginal exposure by separating the edges of the vagina and holding back the tissue. (9) A gynecological fibroid hook is an instrument used to exert traction upon a fibroid. (10) A pelvimeter (external) is an instrument used to measure the external diameters of the pelvis.  \n",

These knives are typically manual, handheld instruments with a straight handle and a conical distal blade with sharp convex edges. The biopsy is performed as a surgical procedure; it is performed only when there is evidence or suspicion of abnormal cells in the cervix.  \n",

These kits typically consist of a collection of devices, instruments, and supplies that are combined to temporarily separate and retain the perineal wall and/or vagina edges, exposing and/or giving access to the vagina, without manual support once they are set (i.e., self-retained). The retractors frequently consist of a flexible, small, properly angulated ring; a set of blades of different sizes usually providing lateral and posterior soft tissue retraction; a ratchet mechanism to adjust retractor tension; and a fixation post that is usually attached to an operating table whose end is dropped. The kits may incorporate fiber optic systems to illuminate the surgical site. Vaginal peritoneal retractor kits provide hands-free assistance to the surgeon during the procedure; dedicated vaginal retractor kits with other physical configurations are also available.  \n",

These surgical hooks typically consist of handheld manual stainless steel instruments that are straight at the working end and finished in a blunt or sharp tip. The hooks typically include a handle at the proximal end. Vasectomy surgical hooks are usually small and sharp tools used to penetrate the skin of the scrotum and pull out the vas deferens so that the surgeon can sever them. They are used during surgical procedures for male sterilization and/or permanent birth control (i.e. vasectomy).  \n",
